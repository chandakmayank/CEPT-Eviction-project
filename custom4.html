            <h1>Mr. Fix evidently was not wanting in a tinge of self-conceit.</h1>

            <p>Little by little the scene on the quay became more animated; sailors of various nations, merchants, ship-brokers, porters, fellahs, bustled to and fro as if the steamer were immediately expected. The weather was clear, and slightly chilly.</p>

            <p>The minarets of the town loomed above the houses in the pale rays of the sun.<br /> A jetty pier, some two thousand yards along, extended into the roadstead.<br /> A number of fishing-smacks and coasting boats, some retaining the fantastic fashion of ancient galleys, were discernible on the Red Sea.</p>
